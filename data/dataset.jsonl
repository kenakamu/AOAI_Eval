In self-attention, each position in a sequence learns to focus on all other positions, forming a weighted sum of their values. Attention weights are derived using queries, keys, and values, with compatibility between a query and key determining attention to each value. This mechanism enables capturing long-range dependencies and relationships within a sequence, making it effective for tasks needing context understanding and inter-part relationships."}], "output": "Self-attention is crucial in transformers, enabling each sequence position to evaluate and collect data from all others.

Unlike recurrent neural networks, transformers process whole sequences at once using self-attention. The architecture consists of an encoder and decoder, each with multiple layers of multi-head attention, feed-forward networks, and normalization layers. The encoder processes the input sequence, and the decoder produces the output sequence. Positional encodings are added to retain sequence order information since the model lacks inherent sequence position awareness. This architecture underlies many leading language models like BERT and GPT."}], "output": "Transformers are a transformative neural architecture processing sequences with self-attention instead of recurrence.
